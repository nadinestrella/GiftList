# The Gift List 😀👧👶🎁

Welcome to **The Gift List**, an interactive web application designed to make gift-giving occasions a breeze for parents and a world of fun for kids. With "The Gift List", children have the delightful opportunity to explore various toy categories and select their top three favorites, making sure their wishes are communicated directly and efficiently to their parents.

## Features 🤳

- **Toy Categories**: Kids can browse through a selection of toy categories to find exactly what they're interested in.
- **Curated Selection**: Each category showcases 6 carefully selected toys to ensure a variety of options without overwhelming choice.
- **Child-Friendly Interface**: Designed with young users in mind, our interface is simple, intuitive, and safe for kids to navigate.
- **Parental Notification**: (work in progress) Once a selection is made, parents receive a neatly compiled list of the 3 chosen toys, making it easy to keep track of their child's current favorites.
